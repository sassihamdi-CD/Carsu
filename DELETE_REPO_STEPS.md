# How to Delete a GitHub Repository

## Steps

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/sassihamdi-CD/Carsu
   - Or navigate via your GitHub profile

2. **Click on "Settings" tab:**
   - Located in the top menu bar of the repository

3. **Scroll down to "Danger Zone":**
   - This section is at the very bottom of the Settings page
   - It's usually in red/orange to indicate destructive actions

4. **Click "Delete this repository":**
   - It's a red button in the Danger Zone

5. **Confirm deletion:**
   - GitHub will ask you to type the repository name to confirm
   - Type: `sassihamdi-CD/Carsu` (or just `Carsu` depending on the prompt)
   - Click "I understand the consequences, delete this repository"

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **This action is PERMANENT** - you cannot undo it
- **Your local code will NOT be deleted** - it stays on your computer
- **All GitHub issues, pull requests, and wiki content will be deleted**
- **The repository URL will become unavailable**

## ✅ What Happens

- Repository is removed from GitHub
- All remote history is deleted
- Your local repository (on your computer) is UNCHANGED
- You can push to a new repository anytime

## After Deletion

Once deleted, you can:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Add it as a new remote
3. Push your local code to the new repository

## Alternative: Make Repository Private

If you want to keep it but hide it instead of deleting:
- Go to Settings → General
- Scroll to "Danger Zone"
- Click "Change visibility" → "Make private"

This hides it from public view but keeps all history.
