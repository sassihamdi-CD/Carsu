Subject: Re: Development Task Submission - Carsu Take-Home Assignment

Hi Etay,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this development task. I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to let you know that I submitted the task a bit later than initially plannedâ€”I noticed your email later in the week and began implementation shortly thereafter. However, I'd like to clarify that the actual development time invested in this project was under 8 hours, staying within a reasonable timeframe for the scope of work.

I'm pleased to submit my solution for your review. Here is the repository:

**Repository**: https://github.com/sassihamdi-CD/Carsu

## What I've Built

The application is a complete multi-tenant collaborative todo system with:

- **Multi-tenancy**: Strict tenant isolation with row-level security
- **Real-time collaboration**: WebSocket-based updates using Socket.IO
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with tenant membership checks
- **Full CRUD operations**: For boards and todos with proper tenant scoping
- **Frontend demo**: React application demonstrating all features
- **Testing**: Unit tests with good coverage
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline (all checks passing)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: README with architecture diagrams

## Quick Start

The application can be run easily with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

All setup instructions, API documentation, and architecture details are available in the README.

I've ensured the code follows best practices with clean architecture, proper error handling, security considerations, and extensive documentation. All tests pass, and the CI pipeline is configured and working.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the implementation.

Thank you again for this opportunity. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Sassi Hamdi]
